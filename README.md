### Encrypted

We never store your password. Your password is used as a key to encrypt your notepad. The encrypted output is then stored in our database, and without the password, it is essentially just a random set of characters.

### Zero Identifiers

Your notepad names are hashed before being stored in our database. This ensures that even if your password is compromised, it is impossible for anyone to determine your note name and read the contents.

### Zero Logins

An anonymity-focused solution. Only a password is needed to encrypt your notes, so there's no need for you to log in or provide your email or any other personal information. No analytics, third-party cookies, or site tracking.
